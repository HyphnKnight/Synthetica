Actually I think the best options is somewhere halfway between both. The simulation is going to be run, but there are several major events that happen at scripted times.

##Mothership
The mothership is where the player's character is located. It is a mobile base which the player can fly from system to system, collecting resources and producing units.

Power can be redirected around a ship depending on the situation

Time warp ( warp core allow to fast travel and control battle speed );

###Modules
* **Command Core** Where the players character is, where AI is created
    * AI Terminal: Determines what AI limitations you have.
    * Communication Array: Determines at what distance AI can be reprogrammed.
* **Factory** Where unit elements are produced and where units themselves are assembled.
    * Manufacturing: This is where specific elements are produced
    * Designer: This is where units are designed.
* **Engines**
    * Atmospheric Engines: This determines size of the ship the player can build while still leaving a planets atmosphere.
    * Interstellar Engines: This determines the speed the ship in interstellar space.
    * Atmospheric
* **Reactor** The core of the ship determines the maximum abilities of the ship
    * Core: Produces energy for the ship
    * Microwave Array: Beams energy to nearby units
* **Cargo Bay** Where items are stored.
    * Hanger: Determines how many cubic Square feet of units can be stored
    * Resource: Determines how many resources you can bring with you.
* **Labratory** Where new tech is discovered
    * Energy: Research Energy related tech, including core technology, engines, communication Array, and MicroWave Array.
    * Materials: Research tech related to expanding the ship, and building new types of unit Elements.
* **Artillery Array** A Series of cannons
    * Deployment

##Units
Units can operate independently but also can be grouped together into swarms, and each swarm can be given an AI commander as well.

###AI
* Individual commands
* Subroutines are collections of commands
* AI are collections of subroutines

###Commands
* Order of Commands determines the priority of actions.
* IF [STATE] THEN [ACTION]
* IF [DEFAULT] THEN [ACTION]
* [ACTION]


###Elements
* Movement: Wheels, Bipedal, Hover, Flying
* Sensors: Geology, Seismic, Heat, Camera
* Weapons: Beam, Missile, Slug
* AI: core


## Gameplay

### Factions
* **Bugs** The closest sentient beings in the universe, these bugs consider humans to be a invasive species that has resisted all attempts to communicate.

#System Details
A bright pulsar star lays at the center of the solar system.
A thick asteroid belt is located mid way through the system protecting outer planets from a constant bombardment of radiation.
The outer planets consist of one gas giant very close to the asteroid belt, a planet with a thick atmosphere that contains several moons which
